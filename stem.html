<h1>Robyn Sue Fisher's journey to success</h1>
<img src="smittenicecream-8.jpg" alt="smittenicecream" width="280" height="250">
<p>Robyn Sue Fisher has long been enamored with the idea of taking something old and making it new again. As an adult, armed with a Stanford MBA, she has spent more than a decade in pursuit of pure joy— which to Fisher takes the form of ice cream. And she hasn’t just been ice cream parlorhopping, attempting to track down the absolute best chilled creations out there, though these days that is considered R&D for her. Fisher has taken her love of the frozen treat to the next level with her Smitten Ice Cream (smittenicecream.com), which marries a back-to-basics approach to ingredients with state-of-the-art machinery for a product that is “unprocessed and real, with amazing taste and texture,” she proclaims.
